<p align="center"><i>"Finally, a tool that makes screen sessions as simple as they should be!"</i></p>

## The Problem

If you've ever used the Linux `screen` command, you know the experience:

- Struggling to remember cryptic commands: `screen -list`, `screen -r 1234.pts-0.hostname`
- Hunting through messy session lists to find your work
- Accidentally creating multiple sessions when you meant to attach to existing ones
- Fighting with detached sessions and complicated syntax

**You're not alone.** Thousands of developers waste precious time on these frustrations every day.

## The Solution: `s`

`s` is a minimalist CLI tool that makes terminal session management **dead simple** while keeping all the power of `screen` that you actually need.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Try It in 10 Seconds

```bash
# Install with one command
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kolarski/s/master/install.sh | bash

# List all sessions
s
# You'll see something like this:
ID              NAME                           CREATED AT
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1372328         my-background-task             21.03.2025 13:16:53

# Create or attach to a session - that's it!
s my-project

# To detach from a session (return to your regular terminal)
Ctrl+A, then D
```

## How `s` Changes Your Workflow

### Before `s`:

```bash
# List sessions
screen -list
# Output: complicated list with numbers and dots

# Create a session
screen -S my-long-session-name

# Attach to a detached session
screen -r 1234.my-long-session
# Oops, error: "There is no screen to be resumed matching 1234.my-long-session."
```

### After `s`:

```bash
# List sessions
s
# Output:
ID              NAME                           CREATED AT
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1372328         my-background-task             21.03.2025 13:16:53

# Create or attach to a session
s my-project
# That's it!
```

## Core Commands You'll Use Daily

| Task                       | Command       | What it Does                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| List all sessions          | `s`           | Shows a clean, human-readable table              |
| Create/attach to a session | `s name`      | Creates if it doesn't exist, attaches if it does |
| Kill a session             | `s kill name` | Removes the session                              |

## Why Developers Stick With `s`

- **One-Letter Simplicity**: Just type `s` and you're productive
- **Zero Learning Curve**: If you can type, you can use it
- **Smart Context Awareness**: Creates or attaches based on what you need
- **Increased Productivity**: Save ~5-10 seconds on every session interaction (adds up to hours saved!)
- **Designed for Real Workflows**: Built by developers for actual day-to-day usage patterns

## What Users Say

> "I've been using screen for 10 years and switching to `s` has been a game-changer. So much simpler!"

> "This tiny tool saves me at least 15 minutes of frustration every day."

> "I installed this on our entire team's machines. Everyone loves it."

## <a name="installation"></a>Installation

### ‚úÖ Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kolarski/s/master/install.sh | bash
```

The script intelligently:

- Detects your OS
- Downloads the appropriate binary
- Installs to the correct location
- Adds to your PATH if needed

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kolarski/s.git
cd s
cargo install --path .
```

## Requirements

- Linux `screen` command must be installed
- Compatible with Linux and macOS

## Under the Hood

`s` is built with modern software engineering practices that ensure reliability, maintainability, and performance:

- **üì¶ Written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)**: Delivering memory safety without a garbage collector, thread safety without data races, and abstraction without overhead
- **üèõÔ∏è [Domain Driven Design](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html)**: Focused on core domain logic and complex domain models to solve real developer problems
- **üß± [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)**: Separation of concerns that makes the codebase modular, testable, and easy to maintain
- **üöÄ Minimal Dependencies**: Lightweight and fast with careful selection of external libraries

`s` is intentionally designed as a thin wrapper around the robust `screen` utility rather than reimplementing its functionality. This approach leverages the stability and feature set of `screen` while providing a dramatically simplified interface for everyday use.

For developers interested in contributing or building similar tools, our codebase serves as an excellent example of applying these principles to a focused utility.
